# logging-receiver

Server able to receive Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) records via TCP socket connection.

* collects log records from multiple processes or services
* central point to collect logs
* saves records to file in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format
* can rotate log files
* can compress log files on rotation and use timestamp in file name

* other services (such as [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/de/elastic-stack)) could pick up log files from this service

```
docker build . -t logging-receiver
docker run --rm -v $PWD/logs:/app/logs -v $PWD/config.json:/app/config.json:ro -p 9000:9000 -it logging-receiver
